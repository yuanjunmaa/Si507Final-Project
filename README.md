# Si507Final-Project
This project uses 'Yelp Fusion' and 'Twitter API'. Users need to go the 'Yelp Fusion'
(https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started) and 'Twitter API'
(https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) to acquire their own keys and 
secrets to run the program. People will interact with the program through two questioins.
First, they have to answer which city do they want to eat. Second, they need to specify the type of food they want to eat.
After users answer two questioins. After answering the questions, a bar graph, scatter plot, and a web page by Flask will 
automatically be displayed with the information about restaurant and the time people mentioned the restaurant on Twitter.
